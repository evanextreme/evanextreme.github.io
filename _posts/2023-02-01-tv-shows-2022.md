title: Evan's Favorite Shows of 2022
---
(*this post is unfinished, shut up*) I watch a lot of shows, because I consider myself some sort of critic and love to seem smart. Just kidding, I generally enjoy slower more character driven storytelling the series format provides. Because i'm such a couch potato, every year I make a list of my favorite shows. I'll keep updating this one until every show that premieres this year that I care about finishes (so likely february 2023). The rules are to be a "current year" show the first episode had to air in that year. That's because with a few [notable exceptions](https://www.cartoonbrew.com/ideas-commentary/6-days-to-air-reveals-south-parks-insane-production-schedule-67657.html) most series finish production of all episodes before the first one hits the air! Can't believe that's an ancient phrase now. Well actually I can. Anyways, here's my not finished list. Subject to change (tm)

## The List

1. Severance (Season 1, Apple TV+) - Brilliant television. One of the most brilliantly written and best directed dramas in years. this feels like it was algorithmically cooked up in a vat of every science fiction show from the 2010’s that I fell in love with. It has the ambiance of Counterpart, the mind bending writing of Mr. Robot / season 1 of Homecoming, and the mystery / world building of Westworld. It’s been a long time since a cliffhanger of a show has hit me this hard. I can’t fucking wait for season 2
2. Peacemaker (Season 1, HBO Max) - pretty good, pretty fun!
3. Smiling Friends (Season 1, Adult Swim) - the renaissance men are coming to town
4. Righteous Gemstones (Season 2, HBO) - praiseeeeee
5. Raised By Wolves (Season 2, HBO Max)

At this point on the list, I dont think i'd recommend anything here. These are just shows ive seen and want to comment on. So lets do that.

* Halo (Season 1, Paramount+) - Meh. Could have been a lot better than it was. I don't even entirely mind the venture from the canon of the original series
* Star Trek Picard (Season 2, Paramount+) - Didn't even finish. I am only watching this show so I have more context to the [red letter media videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SP2HJ_XppbU). made it all the way up to the season finale somehow

### Not finished / still watching

* Atlanta (Season 3, FX) - it’s after the end of the world, don’t you know that yet?
* Hacks (Season 2, HBO Max)
* Star Trek: Strange New Worlds (Season 1, Paramount+)

### Other stuff I watched this year

* The entirety of The X-Files
* A few seasons of Star Trek Deep Space 9, for the third (or fourth?) time
* Home Movies
