(Disclaimer: I am a software engineer who works on Azure for Microsoft. My views do not represent my employer, just as your views dont represent yours. Additionally, I do not claim to be an expert in anything I am discussing here. This might read like a long winded rant sent in a discord server, because if I didnt create this blog it probably would have been one.)

Most of the time the tech industry is a chaotic mess, filled with uncertainty and failed ideas for the future. Various platforms, operating systems, and computing paradigms come and go, with thousands of "world changing" ideas proposed each year by those who believe they're the next great visionary product genius. Unlike what subscribers to the myth of the male genius would want you to believe, the entire direction of the industry shifting is never the result of a single person. Rather these massive shifts are built through new technological innovations _in combination_ with multiple _consumer focused_ use cases which create a new product category. I haven't personally been alive super long, but here are some of the shifts I have knowledge of and were present for:

* The popularization of the graphical user interface / desktop paradigm
* Affordable home internet
* The modern smartphone
* The internet of things / voice assistants

The last one (IoT) was caused not by a singular "moment" rather than a ton of companies throwing a bunch of networking chips in random things and accidentally arriving at an intuitive way to control them through voice.
